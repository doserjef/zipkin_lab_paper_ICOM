# Code for Analysis

1. `bird-data-prep.R`: preps the raw BBS and eBird data for analysis. The raw eBird and BBS data files are not currently on Github. Currently, the script only produces data from PA, although we may extend this out to the entire Northeast.  
2. `icom-ne-birds-nimble.R`: NIMBLE code for running the ICOM with eBird and BBS data for a community of interior forest obligates. 
3. `main.R`: main script for runing the ICOM through NIMBLE.
